# README.md

A `README.md` file is a very useful component of any project repository. As you can see, it is automatically rendered on GitHub, where it acts as a simple "homepage" for your project.

## About

The purpose of this repository is to distribute handouts during a SESYNC training event. The content changes between short courses, but it typically includes the worksheets for severl lessons. Most trainees will import this repository during a short course. Instructions for creating your own GitHub repository will be given during the course and are also described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Data

[Download](https://files.sesync.org/pydio/public/09bb83) a zipped data file that accompanies the worksheets. A typical data-synthesis pipeline keeps the data and source code in separate locations&mdash;we'll do the same for this short course.

## Past Events

**Following** a short course, the worksheets and data will be archived as a zip file. To get the handouts from a past short course: navigate to [releases](https://github.com/sesync-ci/handouts/releases), select your course by its starting date, and download `Source code (zip)` and `data.zip`. The downloads do not contain a git repositoryâ€”only the worksheets and necessary data.
